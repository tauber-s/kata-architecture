# üß¨ Template

This is a template created by Diego Pacheco which the goal to better describe a tought process which is called architecture. This should be used to learn software architecture and to pratice with use cases.

## üèõÔ∏è Structure

### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

**Mr. Bill wants a multi-tenant system where:**
- Users can register their PoCs.
- Users can search PoCs by name, programming language, and tags.
- The system should allow report generation and the ability to generate a yearly video compilation of all PoCs.
- The platform must support real-time dojos (collaborative learning sessions inside the app).
- The app must be secure with proper login and tenant isolation.
- The solution must be delivered as a mobile app (native, not Ionic).
- The backend must run on AWS, not as a monolith, not with single AZ, and not serverless/Lambda.
- The database cannot be MongoDB or a single relational DB.
- It needs to be scalable, because it will be sold to many companies with multiple users.

**Context**
- **End users:** Developers.
- **Market:** Brazilian tech companies (but should be designed with global expansion in mind).
- **Business model:** SaaS (multi-tenant).

**Non-functional requirements**
- **Scalability:** support growth as adoption increases.
- **Availability:** no single AZ, so multi-AZ at minimum.
- **Security:** tenant isolation, secure authentication, encrypted storage.
- **Performance:** fast search (tags, name, language).
- **Extensibility:** future-proof for new features like AI-assisted recommendations.

### 2. üéØ Goals

1. **Multi-tenancy:** The system must isolate data per tenant, ensuring no leakage between customers.
2. **Secure access:** Strong authentication and authorization, encrypted storage, and data-in-transit encryption.
3. **Native mobile experience:** Build the mobile app natively (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android).
4. **PoC management:** Create, edit, delete, and search PoCs (by name, programming language, tags).
5. **Search performance:** Search queries must return results in < 200ms for typical workloads.
6. **Reporting:** Generate report dashboards with aggregated PoC information.
7. **Video generation:** Ability to generate a yearly compilation video of all PoCs per user.
8. **Real-time dojos:** Enable synchronous code writing, chat and voice call inside the platform.
9. **Scalability & Availability:** Multi-AZ deployment on AWS, must scale horizontally.
10. **Observability:** Logging, metrics, and tracing from day one.

### 3. üéØ Non-Goals

1. **On-premise deployments:** The system will only be SaaS, no support for local installs.
2. **Cross-cloud support:** AWS is the mandatory cloud, no support for GCP or Azure.
3. **Monolithic architecture:** The system will not be delivered as a monolith, we will design distributed services.
4. **Serverless/Lambda-first approach:** Explicitly forbidden by restriction, we‚Äôll use containers/ECS/EKS instead.
5. **Single AZ setup:** Not acceptable, high availability is a must.
6. **NoSQL MongoDB:** Excluded by restriction, we‚Äôll use relational and specialized stores.
7. **Single relational DB for everything:** We‚Äôll separate concerns (e.g. PoCs in Postgres, search in Elasticsearch, media in S3).
8. **Offline-first mobile support:** Not in scope for the MVP. Users must be online.
9. **Third-party video editing features:** Beyond generating yearly compilations, full-fledged video editing is not a goal.
10. **Enterprise-level AI recommendations:** AI-based features are nice-to-have, but not in MVP scope.

### üìê 3. Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
    * Each service should handle a single bounded responsibility (e.g., PoC service, reporting service, video generation service).
    * This avoids accidental coupling and simplifies scaling.

2. **Multi-Tenancy by Design**
    * Tenant data must be isolated logically at the database layer (e.g., tenant_id column and row-level security) and at the storage layer (e.g., per-tenant S3 folders).
    * No shared queries without explicit tenant scoping.

3. **Security First**
    * Authentication via standards (OAuth2/OpenID Connect).
    * Authorization with role and tenant-based access.
    * Data encryption at rest (KMS, RDS encryption) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).

4. **Cloud-Native and AWS-First**
    * Use AWS managed services (RDS, ECS/EKS, S3, ElastiCache, OpenSearch) to reduce operational overhead.
    * No monoliths, no single-AZ setups, no vendor lock-in beyond AWS basics.

5. **Scalability via Horizontal Scaling**
    * All services must be stateless and run in containers.
    * Persistent state only in managed databases or object storage.

6. **Observability Built-In**
    * Collect metrics (Prometheus compatible), logs and distributed traces.
    * Dashboards and alerts defined as code (Grafana/CloudWatch).

7. **APIs as Contracts**
    * Services communicate via well-defined APIs (REST/gRPC).
    * Contracts must be versioned and backward-compatible where possible.

8. **Event-Driven for Async Work**
    * Use Kafka or AWS MSK for decoupling long-running jobs (e.g., video generation, reporting).
    * Sync APIs only for quick user-facing operations.

9. **Fail-Fast, Resilient by Default**
    * Use retries, circuit breakers, bulkheads.
    * Chaos testing baked into CI/CD pipelines.

10. **Evolvability**
    * Architecture must allow new services to be added without re-architecting.
    * ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) should capture major decisions.

### üß≠ 5. Trade-offs

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions: 
```
1. One mobile code base - should be (...)
2. Reusable capability and low latency backends should be (...)
3. Cache efficiency therefore should do (...)
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. React Native vs (Flutter and Native)
2. Serverless vs Microservices
3. Redis vs Enbeded Caches
```
Each tradeoff line need to be:
```
PROS (+) 
  * Benefit: Explanation that justify why the benefit is true.
CONS (+)
  * Problem: Explanation that justify why the problem is true.
```
PS: Be careful to not confuse problem with explanation.

##### 6.3.3 - Partitioning Strategy

**Partitioning**

We considered three partitioning options for our multi-tenant database:

- **Option A ‚Äì Partition by `tenant_id`:**  
  Best when we have a small number of tenants, each with large datasets. Provides strong tenant isolation.

- **Option B ‚Äì Partition by time (`created_at` / `started_at`):**  
  Useful for time-based queries (recent PoCs, videos, katas).

- **Option C ‚Äì Hybrid (partition by `tenant_id`, sub-partition by time):**  
  Good for many tenants each with large amounts of data. Combines isolation with time-based pruning.

**Decision:**
- At first, we will partition by `tenant_id` if we have a small number of tenants with high data volume.
- If the number of tenants grows too much, we will revert to single schema + `tenant_id` column with indexes.
- If we observe very large datasets per tenant, we adopt hybrid partitioning (`tenant_id` + `time`).

---

**Indexing**

To ensure efficient queries under our multi-tenant design, we will use the following composite indexes:

- **Users**
   - `(tenant_id, cognito_sub)` for fast lookup of users by Cognito identity.

- **PoCs**
   - `(tenant_id, created_at DESC)` for listing/filtering.
   - Index on `tags` and `languages` arrays for fast multi-value search.

- **Katas**
   - `(tenant_id, status, started_at DESC)` for querying active katas.

- **Videos**
   - `(tenant_id, user_id, created_at DESC)` for retrieving videos per user.
