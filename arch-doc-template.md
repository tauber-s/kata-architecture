## üèõÔ∏è Structure

### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

**Mr. Bill wants a multi-tenant system where:**
- Users can register their PoCs.
- Users can search PoCs by name, programming language, and tags.
- The system should allow report generation and the ability to generate a yearly video compilation of all PoCs.
- The platform must support real-time dojos (collaborative learning sessions inside the app).
- The app must be secure with proper login and tenant isolation.
- The solution must be delivered as a mobile app (native, not Ionic).
- The backend must run on AWS, not as a monolith, not with single AZ, and not serverless/Lambda.
- The database cannot be MongoDB or a single relational DB.
- It needs to be scalable, because it will be sold to many companies with multiple users.

**Context**
- **End users:** Developers.
- **Market:** Brazilian tech companies (but should be designed with global expansion in mind).
- **Business model:** SaaS (multi-tenant).

**Non-functional requirements**
- **Scalability:** support growth as adoption increases.
- **Availability:** no single AZ, so multi-AZ at minimum.
- **Security:** tenant isolation, secure authentication, encrypted storage.
- **Performance:** fast search (tags, name, language).
- **Extensibility:** future-proof for new features like AI-assisted recommendations.

### 2. üéØ Goals

1. **Multi-tenancy:** The system must isolate data per tenant, ensuring no leakage between customers.
2. **Secure access:** Strong authentication and authorization, encrypted storage, and data-in-transit encryption.
3. **Native mobile experience:** Build the mobile app natively (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android).
4. **PoC management:** Create, edit, delete, and search PoCs (by name, programming language, tags).
5. **Search performance:** Search queries must return results in < 200ms for typical workloads.
6. **Reporting:** Generate report dashboards with aggregated PoC information.
7. **Video generation:** Ability to generate a yearly compilation video of all PoCs per user.
8. **Real-time dojos:** Enable synchronous code writing, chat and voice call inside the platform.
9. **Scalability & Availability:** Multi-AZ deployment on AWS, must scale horizontally.
10. **Observability:** Logging, metrics, and tracing from day one.

### 3. üéØ Non-Goals

1. **On-premise deployments:** The system will only be SaaS, no support for local installs.
2. **Cross-cloud support:** AWS is the mandatory cloud, no support for GCP or Azure.
3. **Monolithic architecture:** The system will not be delivered as a monolith, we will design distributed services.
4. **Serverless/Lambda-first approach:** Explicitly forbidden by restriction, we‚Äôll use containers/ECS/EKS instead.
5. **Single AZ setup:** Not acceptable, high availability is a must.
6. **NoSQL MongoDB:** Excluded by restriction, we‚Äôll use relational and specialized stores.
7. **Single relational DB for everything:** We‚Äôll separate concerns (e.g. PoCs in Postgres, search in Elasticsearch, media in S3).
8. **Offline-first mobile support:** Not in scope for the MVP. Users must be online.
9. **Third-party video editing features:** Beyond generating yearly compilations, full-fledged video editing is not a goal.
10. **Enterprise-level AI recommendations:** AI-based features are nice-to-have, but not in MVP scope.

### üìê 3. Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
    * Each service should handle a single bounded responsibility (e.g., PoC service, reporting service, video generation service).
    * This avoids accidental coupling and simplifies scaling.

2. **Multi-Tenancy by Design**
    * Tenant data must be isolated logically at the database layer (e.g., tenant_id column and row-level security) and at the storage layer (e.g., per-tenant S3 folders).
    * No shared queries without explicit tenant scoping.

3. **Security First**
    * Authentication via standards (OAuth2/OpenID Connect).
    * Authorization with role and tenant-based access.
    * Data encryption at rest (KMS, RDS encryption) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).

4. **Cloud-Native and AWS-First**
    * Use AWS managed services (RDS, ECS/EKS, S3, ElastiCache, OpenSearch) to reduce operational overhead.
    * No monoliths, no single-AZ setups, no vendor lock-in beyond AWS basics.

5. **Scalability via Horizontal Scaling**
    * All services must be stateless and run in containers.
    * Persistent state only in managed databases or object storage.

6. **Observability Built-In**
    * Collect metrics (Prometheus compatible), logs and distributed traces.
    * Dashboards and alerts defined as code (Grafana/CloudWatch).

7. **APIs as Contracts**
    * Services communicate via well-defined APIs (REST/gRPC).
    * Contracts must be versioned and backward-compatible where possible.

8. **Event-Driven for Async Work**
    * Use Kafka or AWS MSK for decoupling long-running jobs (e.g., video generation, reporting).
    * Sync APIs only for quick user-facing operations.

9. **Fail-Fast, Resilient by Default**
    * Use retries, circuit breakers, bulkheads.
    * Chaos testing baked into CI/CD pipelines.

10. **Evolvability**
    * Architecture must allow new services to be added without re-architecting.
    * ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) should capture major decisions.

### üß≠ 5. Trade-offs

1. Kotlin/Spring Boot vs Go
```   
PROS (+)
  * Maturity & ecosystem: Spring Boot provides integrations with AWS, PostgreSQL, Redis, OpenSearch, and Kafka (MSK), accelerating delivery.
  * Robust typing & productivity: Kotlin adds concision, null-safety, and coroutines; Spring WebFlux supports reactive I/O for high-throughput REST/WebSocket endpoints.
  * Operational readiness: First-class observability (Micrometer/OpenTelemetry) and security (Spring Security + Cognito/OIDC).
CONS (-)
  * Runtime footprint: JVM baseline memory/CPU is higher than Go or Rust, increasing container cost for small instances.
  * Startup and image size: Slower startup and larger images vs Go; impacts scale-to-zero and ultra-fast rollouts.
```
2. Client side
Android and IOS </br>

Pros (+)
  * Better performance
  * Better access to native features

Cons (-)
  * Duplicated development
  * Maintenance cost
  * Risk of inconsistency between versions

WEB (NEXTJS FEBE)

Pros (+)
* SSR/SSG (server side rendering / generating)
* Client side does not know API
* Cache
* React Components

Cons (-)
* Monolith Risk
* Cache complexity

##### 6.3.2 - Main queries
1. Users by cognito_sub
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id AND cognito_sub = ?;
   ```

2. PoCs by filter

   FROM videos
   WHERE user_id = :user_id
   AND tenant_id = :tenant_id
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

##### 6.3.3 - Partitioning Strategy

**Partitioning**

We considered three partitioning options for our multi-tenant database:

- **Option A ‚Äì Partition by `tenant_id`:**  
  Best when we have a small number of tenants, each with large datasets. Provides strong tenant isolation.

- **Option B ‚Äì Partition by time (`created_at` / `started_at`):**  
  Useful for time-based queries (recent PoCs, videos, katas).

- **Option C ‚Äì Hybrid (partition by `tenant_id`, sub-partition by time):**  
  Good for many tenants each with large amounts of data. Combines isolation with time-based pruning.

**Decision:**
- At first, we will partition by `tenant_id` if we have a small number of tenants with high data volume.
- If the number of tenants grows too much, we will revert to single schema + `tenant_id` column with indexes.
- If we observe very large datasets per tenant, we adopt hybrid partitioning (`tenant_id` + `time`).

---

**Indexing**

To ensure efficient queries under our multi-tenant design, we will use the following composite indexes:

- **Users**
   - `(tenant_id, cognito_sub)` for fast lookup of users by Cognito identity.

- **PoCs**
   - `(tenant_id, created_at DESC)` for listing/filtering.
   - Index on `tags` and `languages` arrays for fast multi-value search.

- **Katas**
   - `(tenant_id, status, started_at DESC)` for querying active katas.

- **Videos**
   - `(tenant_id, user_id, created_at DESC)` for retrieving videos per user.

### üñπ 7. Migrations

No migrations, since this is a brand-new system.

### üñπ 8. Testing strategy

E2E testing: e2e can be used to ensure application key functionalities work.


### üñπ 9. Observability strategy

The observability strategy for the platform is designed to ensure **end-to-end visibility**, **early failure detection**, and **continuous security monitoring**.

#### 9.1 Techniques and Principles

We follow the principle of **Observability by Design**, with automatic collection of:

- **Metrics** (CloudWatch and Prometheus-compatible exporters): covering both infrastructure and application-level KPIs.
- **Structured logs**: including `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `request_id`, and `service`.
- **Distributed tracing**: enabled by AWS X-Ray across all microservices.
- **Threat detection**: using AWS GuardDuty and continuous audit logs via CloudTrail.
- **Dashboards and alerts as code**: managed via CloudFormation or CDK and version-controlled.

#### 9.2 Types of Observability

| Type           | Tools / Focus                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Metrics**    | CloudWatch + Prometheus (Kubernetes, App metrics)  |
| **Logs**       | CloudWatch Logs + OpenSearch                       |
| **Tracing**    | AWS X-Ray (end-to-end distributed tracing)         |
| **Audit**      | AWS CloudTrail                                     |
| **Security**   | AWS GuardDuty                                      |

#### 9.3 Key Metrics

We track both **infrastructure performance** and **application behavior**.

##### Infrastructure (via CloudWatch):

- CPU and memory usage per pod (via Container Insights)
- Network traffic per service
- Pod restarts and health checks
- Redis (ElastiCache) latency, throughput, command rate

##### Application:

- Request latency and error rate per endpoint
- PoC creation and Kata session throughput
- Active dojo sessions (count, average duration)
- Active users per tenant
- Report generation performance

##### Security:

- Failed login attempts per IP
- Suspicious behavior and access patterns (GuardDuty)
- Audit trail for sensitive operations (CloudTrail)

#### 9.4 Logging Strategy

All services log in **structured JSON format**, with the following standard fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "tenant_id": "abc-123",
  "user_id": "user-456",
  "request_id": "req-789",
  "service": "kata-service",
  "message": "User joined kata room",
  "status_code": 200
}
```
Logs are sent to **CloudWatch Logs**.

Critical logs are mirrored to **Amazon OpenSearch** for advanced search and dashboarding.

---

#### 9.5 Tracing (AWS X-Ray)

Distributed tracing is enabled across all service-to-service communication and asynchronous flows.

- `request_id` and `trace_id` are propagated by default.
- Enables identification of bottlenecks, slow API calls, and high-latency services.

---

#### 9.6 Dashboard Design

Dashboards are implemented in **CloudWatch Dashboards** (optionally **Grafana** via OpenSearch), and include:

- **Platform overview**: total requests, average latency, error rate
- **Tenant dashboards**: per-tenant usage, active users, ongoing sessions
- **Service-level dashboards**: custom metrics per microservice
- **Real-time monitoring**: active dojo sessions, rooms, participants
- **Video processing**: job statuses (pending, processing, failed, completed)

All dashboards are defined as code and version-controlled through the CI/CD pipeline.

---

#### 9.7 Alerting Strategy

All critical alarms are defined using **CloudWatch Alarms** and delivered via **SNS** (email, Slack, etc.).

Alerts are based on **SLO-driven thresholds**, such as:

- HTTP error rate > 5% over 5 minutes
- API latency > 2 seconds on key endpoints
- Multiple failed login attempts within a short window
- Video generation job failures
- Spike in pod restarts in the EKS cluster

Alerts are always tested in staging before being promoted to production.

---

#### **2. Deployment Pipeline**

- **CI/CD Strategy:**
  - The project uses a fully automated AWS-native CI/CD pipeline to ensure reliable, repeatable, and fast deployments.

- **AWS CodeCommit:**
  - Git-based source control repository hosting all application code and infrastructure as code (IaC).

- **AWS CodeBuild:**
  - Builds and tests container images, runs unit/integration tests, performs security scanning, and pushes images to Amazon ECR.

- **AWS CodePipeline:**
  - Orchestrates the entire CI/CD flow, triggering builds on commit or pull request merges, and promotes artifacts from dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production environments.

- **AWS CodeDeploy:**
  - Deploys updated container images to Amazon EKS using rolling updates or blue/green deployments with zero downtime.
  - Integrates with ALB target groups for automatic traffic shifting and health checks before finalizing deployment.


This pipeline ensures continuous integration, continuous delivery, and fast rollback in case of failures.

---

#### **4. DevOps & Infrastructure**

- **Hosting / Cloud:**
    - AWS ‚Äî using managed services (RDS for PostgreSQL, Elasticache for Redis, etc.). 
- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent environments across development, staging, production.
